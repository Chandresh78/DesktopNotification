# DesktopNotification
In my Python script, I use the plyer library to create periodic notifications reminding me to take a break. The code runs in an infinite loop, and every 20 seconds, it displays a notification with the title "*** Please Take Rest ***" and the message "Rest reduces stress." I've specified an icon for the notification, and I've included a try-except block to allow me to stop the script manually by pressing Ctrl+C. This way, I can receive regular reminders to rest and reduce stress while working on my computer.
